# Backbone.CrossDomain

## Overview

This is an extension for Backbone.js with a Sync that adds support for IE 7-9 CORS requests using IE's XDomainRequest Object while maintaining compatibility with non-IE systems.

This is intended as a drop-in replacement for the default Backbone.sync so you should be able to just plop this in and Cross Domain Requests (using CORS) should just magically work on IE.

## Installation

You can manually download/install this library or grab it with npm:

```
npm install Backbone.CrossDomain
```

## Usage

Include Backbone.CrossDomain after including Backbone.js:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="Backbone.CrossDomain.js"></script>
```

And that's it! Now anything that uses Backbone.sync() internally should work with a cross domain request from IE7/8/9 where they didn't previously. This means model.fetch(), model.save(), model.sync, collection.fetch(), etc.

### RequireJS

This library has AMD support for use with RequireJS. This is not necessary to use this library but helpful when building an app with AMD.

Include [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org):

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="lib/require.js"></script>
```

RequireJS config (with Backbone and Underscore using a shim):
```javascript
require.config({
    paths: {
        jquery: "lib/jquery",
        underscore: "lib/underscore",
        backbone: "lib/backbone",
        crossdomain: "lib/Backbone.CrossDomain"
    },
    shim: {
        underscore: {
            exports: '_'
        },
        backbone: {
            deps: ['underscore', 'jquery'],
            exports: 'Backbone'
        }
    }
});
```

Require crossdomain:
```javascript
require(["underscore", "backbone", "crossdomain"], function(_, Backbone) {
    // Define your models and collections as normal
});
```

Use Backbone as you would normally, this is a drop-in replacement and shouldn't require anything to change.
